One Splitter is pretty annoying to fight against as long as their vulnerable sides are not presented
It is kinda fun though. Just need to get them to a point where they can charge, or at least present their weak side
regular zomble is kinda boring.  Need to give them more unique behaviors, such as charging/sprinting.
