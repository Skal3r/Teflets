One Splitter is pretty annoying to fight against as long as their vulnerable sides are not presented
It is kinda fun though. Just need to get them to a point where they can charge, or at least present their weak side
regular zomble is kinda boring.  Need to give them more unique behaviors, such as charging/sprinting.

having a flat representation of health isn't as enjotyable- need to increase value of points closer to zero to make low health moments easier and more exciting

Ranger is weird to play against. He moves oddly, and sometimes charges. Kinda funny though
